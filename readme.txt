Thihs program will produce a series of values that are obtained by passing solution vectors through two
optimization functions: Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution Algorithm.

There are adjustable values for the algorithms. These value can be found in populationParameters.txt
which can be found in the parameters director. The top half of the file are the values themselves and
the bottom half is instructions on what the values are, as well as how to adjust them.


How to generate the results:
    cd to src
    $ ./build.sh
    $ ./run.sh
